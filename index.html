            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Thasnima and I'm a career changer looking to join the tech world. In my previous career I was a dentist and worked for 8 years in lots of different places. I've dabbled in code for a few years and love the problem solving algorithms. Since I went on maternity leave I've picked up web development in my spare time and I've been hooked ever since.</p>
            <p>At school I always loved maths and problem solving but when it came to careers advice it was always the traditional vocations that able students were pushed towards. I'm a second generation immigrant and sometimes the pressure of having a stable profession to make the sacrifices of our parents and grandparents worthwhile can be confusing. Alas, I've found coding now and it's a Hello, World! from me.</p>
